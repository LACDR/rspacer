# Contributing Guidelines

:tada: **First off, thank you for considering contributing to our project!** :tada:

Although this project has been created by us to improve our RSpace data management workflows, 
usability and extensibility by the wider RSpace community has always been on our mind, 
and we very much welcome contributions and collaborations!

These are some of the many ways to contribute:

* :bug: Submitting bug reports and feature requests
* :memo: Writing tutorials or examples
* :mag: Fixing typos and improving the documentation
* :bulb: Writing code for everyone to use

If you get stuck at any point you can create an issue on GitHub (look for the *Issues*
tab in the repository) or contact the [corresponding author and maintainer](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/gerhard-burger).

## Ground Rules

The goal is to maintain a diverse community that's pleasant for everyone.
**Please be considerate and respectful of others**.
