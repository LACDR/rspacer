# rspacer

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rspacer is to wrap the [RSpace API](https://community.researchspace.com/public/apiDocs), that is, allow you to use the API directly from R using convenience functions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rspacer with

```{r, eval=F}
remotes::install_github("burgerga/rspacer")
```

## Usage

See the [Get started](https://burgerga.github.io/rspacer/articles/rspacer.html) article how to use this package.

**NB:** API Paging/rate limiting is not properly handled yet, but this can be worked around.
